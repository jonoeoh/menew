*   Remove `BackburnerAdapter` from `ActiveJob`.
    `ActiveJob::QueueAdapters::BackburnerAdapter` is implemented inside the latest `backburner` gem release.

    *Dino Maric*, *Nathan Esquenazi* 

*   Remove `sucker_punch` as an adapter option [since author himself recommends using AJ's own AsyncAdapter](https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch?tab=readme-ov-file#faq).
    If you're using this adapter, change to `adapter: async` for the same functionality.

    *Dino Maric*

*   Use `RAILS_MAX_THREADS` in `ActiveJob::AsyncAdapter`. If it is not set, use 5 as default.
